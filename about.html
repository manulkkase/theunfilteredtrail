                <h2>G'day! I'm Your Trail Guide</h2>

                <p>Three years ago, I was just another Aussie backpacker with a one-way ticket to Seoul and absolutely no clue what I was getting myself into. Fast forward to today, and I'm writing this from a cafe in Saigon's District 1, surrounded by the beautiful chaos of motorbikes, street food vendors, and that unmistakable energy that makes Southeast Asia so addictive.</p>

                <p>What happened in between? I fell completely, utterly, and permanently in love with two of Asia's most electric cities.</p>

                <h2>How It All Started</h2>

                <p>Like most travel stories, mine began with a quarter-life crisis and a savings account that desperately needed emptying. Seoul was supposed to be a six-month adventure – teach some English, eat some kimchi, tick "lived in Asia" off the bucket list, and head home with some Instagram-worthy photos.</p>

                <p>Instead, Seoul grabbed me by the throat and refused to let go.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The moment I successfully navigated the Gangnam subway interchange during rush hour without getting trampled, I knew I was becoming something more than just a tourist."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Six months turned into two years. I learned Korean (badly), survived a Seoul winter (barely), and discovered that the real city exists in the spaces between tourist attractions – in 24-hour jjimjilbangs, basement noraebang rooms, and pojangmacha tents where locals actually eat.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>From Seoul to Saigon</h2>

                <p>Just when I thought I had Asia figured out, Vietnam happened.</p>

                <p>A mate's wedding in Ho Chi Minh City was supposed to be a quick detour before heading back to Australia. Instead, I found myself in a city that was everything Seoul wasn't – chaotic where Seoul was organized, warm where Seoul was cold, impossibly affordable where Seoul had cleaned out my bank account.</p>

                <p>Within a week, I was apartment hunting in District 3.</p>

                <p>Saigon taught me that Asia isn't one thing – it's thousands of different experiences, each one ready to completely upend everything you thought you knew about travel, food, and what it means to feel at home somewhere.</p>

                <h2>The DM Phenomenon</h2>

                <p>Somewhere along the way, I became *that friend* – the one everyone hits up with "urgent" travel questions at all hours:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Mate, flying to Seoul next month – where should I stay?"</li>
                    <li>"Is Saigon safe for solo female travelers?"</li>
                    <li>"How much should I budget for street food?"</li>
                    <li>"What's the deal with Vietnamese coffee?"</li>
                    <li>"Help! I'm lost in Myeongdong and everything's in Korean!"</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After the hundredth 2 AM text asking for restaurant recommendations, I realized I had accidentally become a human guidebook for two of Asia's most incredible cities.</p>

                <h2>Why "The Unfiltered Trail"?</h2>

                <p>Because most travel content is rubbish.</p>

                <p>There, I said it.</p>

                <p>Instagram travel influencers showing you the same five photo spots. Budget blogs that haven't updated their prices since 2015. "Local experiences" that are anything but local. Sponsored content disguised as honest reviews.</p>

                <p>I got tired of watching mates waste money on tourist traps because the internet failed them. I got tired of seeing people miss out on incredible experiences because they didn't know where to look.</p>

                <h2>What You Get Here</h2>

                <p><strong>Real prices.</strong> Updated regularly, in actual currency you can use to plan your budget.</p>

                <p><strong>Local insights.</strong> Not just where to eat, but how to order, what to expect, and how not to look like a complete tourist.</p>

                <p><strong>Honest opinions.</strong> If something's overpriced, overrated, or just plain rubbish, I'll tell you. No affiliate commissions, no sponsored fluff.</p>

                <p><strong>Cultural context.</strong> Understanding why things work the way they do, so you can navigate like someone who belongs.</p>

                <p><strong>Safety advice that actually works.</strong> Street-smart strategies from someone who's made all the mistakes so you don't have to.</p>

                <h2>Living Between Two Worlds</h2>

                <p>These days, I split my time between Seoul and Saigon, and I'm convinced this gives me a unique perspective on both cities. Seoul's efficiency makes me appreciate Saigon's beautiful chaos. Saigon's warmth helps me understand Seoul's more reserved culture.</p>

                <p>Both cities have taught me that the best travel experiences happen when you stop being a tourist and start being a temporary local. When you eat where locals eat, shop where locals shop, and hang out where locals actually want to spend their time.</p>

                <h2>Beyond the Blog</h2>

                <p>When I'm not writing about the perfect bowl of pho or trying to explain why Seoul's subway system is actually a work of art, you'll find me:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Teaching English to Korean students who correct my pronunciation</li>
                    <li>Learning Vietnamese from my motorbike taxi driver</li>
                    <li>Getting lost in both cities' endless neighborhoods</li>
                    <li>Collecting business cards from hole-in-the-wall restaurants</li>
                    <li>Defending my favorite coffee shops from hipster gentrification</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

                <p>Got questions? Spotted an error? Found a new hidden gem I need to know about? Hit me up!</p>
