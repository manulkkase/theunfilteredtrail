Discover the vibrant hues and hidden trails of Seoraksan National Park, guided by childhood memories and family adventures.

- - -

Nothing quite compares to my childhood memories of hiking in Seoraksan National Park during the crisp autumn months. I vividly remember one particular October morning when my family and I set out early, the mist still clinging to the mountainside, painting everything with a dewy, silver glow. As the sun rose, it revealed a riot of colors‚Äîscarlets, golds, and deep emeralds‚Äîthat seemed to set the entire mountain ablaze. It was on this trail, with my parents and siblings, that I learned to truly appreciate the beauty of my homeland. Now, with a family of my own, revisiting these trails has become a cherished autumn ritual.

### The Best Trails for Every Hiker ü•æ

Seoraksan is renowned not only for its stunning foliage but also for its range of trails suitable for all fitness levels. For beginners or families with children, the Biseondae Rock trail offers an easy yet rewarding hike. It's a gentle 3-km path that leads to a large rock formation with picturesque views of the surrounding valley‚Äîperfect for a family picnic as the leaves swirl around you.

For those seeking a bit more adventure, the Ulsanbawi Rock trail is a challenging yet iconic climb. Comprising 888 steps, this trail rewards hikers with unparalleled panoramic views. It‚Äôs a climb I tackled first as a teenager and more recently with my partner, who marveled at the sheer scale of the mountain vistas.

### Skip the Crowds: A Local‚Äôs Alternative ü§´

While the cable car to Gwongeumseong Fortress offers spectacular views and an easier route for many visitors, it's often crowded, especially in peak foliage season. Instead, take the lesser-known Cheonbuldong Valley trail. It's slightly more challenging but offers much more tranquility and a closer connection to nature. Here, you can enjoy the serene sounds of the valley's streams and the rustling of the leaves in peace.

### Temple Visits and Cultural Deep Dives üèØ

No visit to Seoraksan is complete without stopping at the ancient Sinheungsa Temple. However, instead of just snapping a few quick photos, I recommend visiting early in the morning to experience a moment of zen before the crowds arrive. The sound of the morning chants amidst the backdrop of autumn colors is purely magical, a scene that my partner and I share fondly in our travel memories.

### Savoring Sokcho: Culinary Delights After a Day of Hiking üç≤

After a day on the trails, head to Sokcho, a nearby city where culinary delights await. While many tourists flock to the popular seafood restaurants on the main strip, I suggest visiting the local markets for authentic Korean street food. Try the dakgangjeong (sweet and crispy chicken) from a small stall just off the main market area‚Äîit‚Äôs a favorite for my kids. Also, don't miss out on the hotteok (sweet pancakes) filled with brown sugar, nuts, and cinnamon, a perfect treat to warm you up after a day in the autumn air.

### Embracing Seoraksan with Every Step

Revisiting Seoraksan each year is not just about reliving memories or creating new ones with my family; it's about connecting with a part of Korea that remains untouched and true to its natural beauty. Whether you're climbing the rugged steps of Ulsanbawi or enjoying the quiet awe at Sinheungsa, Seoraksan in autumn is a place where every step tells a story, and every view paints a picture.

As your insider guide, I encourage you to explore these paths less traveled, to find your own special moments amidst the autumn leaves, and to create memories that you'll carry with you long after you've left the mountain trails.
