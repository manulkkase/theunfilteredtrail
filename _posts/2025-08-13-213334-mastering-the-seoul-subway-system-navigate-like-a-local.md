### He Used the Wrong Exit: A Real Insider's Guide to Mastering the Seoul Subway

I was waiting for my Australian friend outside Exit 10 of Gangnam station. Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. I called him, and he answered, completely flustered. "I'm here!" he said, "I'm outside a huge Uniqlo!" I sighed. He was at Exit 2, a full 15-minute walk away on the other side of one of Seoul's busiest intersections. He had navigated the lines perfectly but had been defeated by the final, crucial step.

That was the day I realised the secret to mastering the Seoul subway isn't about the map; it's about mastering the exits and the tiny efficiencies that locals know by heart. Forget the basics. This is how you use the subway like you were born here.

### ðŸ‘Ž The Single-Journey Ticket Trap (and the Only Card You Need)

At the station, you'll see machines selling single-journey tickets. For a tourist, this seems logical. It's a trap. It's a slow, expensive, and inconvenient way to travel. You'll pay more per ride, you have to line up every single time, and you have to go through the extra hassle of using a separate machine to get your 500 won deposit back at the end of each trip.

**The Insider Alternative:** The **T-money card** is the only real option. It's not just a convenience; it's your key to the entire system. Buy one for about 2,500 KRW at any convenience store and load it with cash. Hereâ€™s why it's non-negotiable:

* **It's cheaper:** Every ride is discounted.
* **It unlocks transfer discounts:** Switch from subway to bus (or vice-versa) within 30 minutes for free. Single-journey tickets don't allow this.
* **It's versatile:** You can use it to pay for buses, taxis, and even buy snacks at convenience stores.

### ðŸ¤« My Pro-Level Subway Secrets

These two tips will instantly elevate your subway game from tourist to pro.

* **Insider Tip #1: The "Quick Transfer" Door.** Ever wonder why locals are striding purposefully down the platform instead of getting on the nearest car? They're heading for the "quick transfer" door. On the platform screen and in apps like Naver Maps, you'll see numbers like **'5-2'** or **'8-4'**. This tells you the **exact train car (5) and door (2) that will stop directly in front of the stairs or escalator for your transfer line.** Getting on this specific door saves you a huge walk underground. It's the ultimate local time-saving hack.
* **Insider Tip #2: The "Weak Air-Con" Car.** Seoul summers are sweltering, and winters are freezing, and the subway's climate control can be intense. If you're sensitive to the cold blast of summer A/C or the stuffy heat in winter, here's the secret: the cars at the **very front and very back of the train** are officially designated as "weak air-con cars" (*yak-naengbang-cha* / ì•½ëƒ‰ë°©ì°¨). The temperature is noticeably milder. Itâ€™s a small detail that makes a huge difference in comfort.

### âœ… Your Seoul Subway Mastery Checklist

Follow these steps, and you'll be navigating the city with total confidence.

1. **Get a T-money Card.** This is step one. Buy it and load it with at least 10,000 KRW as soon as you arrive.
2. **Download Naver Maps.** Google Maps is not your friend for public transport in Korea. **Naver Maps** is what every local uses. It has the most accurate train times, exit information, and those crucial "quick transfer" door numbers.
3. **Know Your EXIT Number.** Before you even get on the train, look up your destination on Naver Maps and find the **exact exit number** you need. The stations are massive, and the right exit can save you a 15-minute walk, as my partner learned the hard way.
4. **Give Up Your Seat.** You'll notice designated seats for the elderly, disabled, and pregnant passengers (often marked with pink). These are not for you, even if they are empty. It's also customary to offer any regular seat to an elderly person who gets on.
5. **Stay Quiet.** You'll notice the subway cars are surprisingly quiet. Loud conversations are a major cultural faux pas. Keep your voice low and your phone on silent.

The Seoul subway is more than just a way to get from A to B; it's the clean, efficient, and surprisingly quiet circulatory system of my hometown. Once you learn its secrets, you haven't just learned to get aroundâ€”you've unlocked the entire city.
