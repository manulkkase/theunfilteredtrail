**Subtitle:** From Seoul to Busan: Navigate your journey with insights from a Seoul native, tailored for Aussie families.

Every guidebook might start you off at the bustling streets of Myeongdong, but let me take you along the path I walked as a child, where the true heart of Seoul beats. Growing up in the capital city of South Korea, I was always enchanted by the less trodden paths that each hold their own unique tales. Now, let's embark on this journey together, ensuring your two weeks in South Korea are not just memorable but also seamless and family-friendly.

### üõ§Ô∏è Day 1-3: Immersive Seoul Beginnings

Start your adventure in Seoul, where traditional meets modern at every corner. Skip the usual hotel districts and consider staying in Jongno-gu, where you can wake up to the sound of the morning bell at Bosingak Belfry. It's centrally located and provides easy access to historic sites like Gyeongbokgung Palace. Remember, it's not just about visiting; it's about experiencing. Join the locals in a morning exercise session at Bukhansan National Park‚Äîan activity my family cherished during my childhood.

### üöÜ Day 4: KTX to Jeonju

Booking your KTX tickets from Seoul to Jeonju can be a breeze if you use the Korail website or app. Opt for the flexible ticket option, giving you peace of mind if travel plans shift slightly. Jeonju, the birthplace of bibimbap, offers an authentic glimpse into Joseon Dynasty architecture and a slower pace of life. The Jeonju Hanok Village is remarkably stroller-friendly, making it a perfect spot for families to explore without hassle.

### üåä Day 5-7: Coastal Charms of Busan

Take another KTX ride to Busan. This vibrant coastal city is a must-visit for its stunning beaches and fresh seafood. Haeundae Beach is popular, but let me direct you to the quieter Songjeong Beach, a spot my partner and I adore for its less crowded sands and gentle waves, ideal for children. Don‚Äôt forget to indulge in a seafood feast at Jagalchi Fish Market, where the fish couldn't be fresher if it jumped onto your plate itself!

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è Day 8-9: Historical Gyeongju

A short bus ride from Busan, Gyeongju is an open-air museum. With Silla dynasty royal tombs, ancient temples, and expansive parks, it‚Äôs a city that captivates. Plus, the Gyeongju National Museum‚Äôs spacious grounds are perfect for a family picnic, allowing you to soak in history at your own pace.

### üå≤ Day 10-12: Rejuvenating in Jeju Island

Fly from Busan to Jeju Island. Known for its volcanic landscapes and coastal vistas, Jeju is a paradise for nature lovers. Rent a car for the most flexibility (and car seat options for the little ones). Visit the Jeju Folk Village Museum for a dose of culture and Hallasan National Park for a mild trek that offers paths suitable for families.

### üèôÔ∏è Day 13-14: Return to Seoul and Departure

Return to Seoul and spend your last days picking up souvenirs in Insadong, where you can find artisan crafts that are as unique as your trip. For a relaxed final day, visit the lesser-known Seonyudo Park, a beautiful island park in the Hangang River, perfect for letting the kids play while you unwind.

South Korea offers an array of experiences that go beyond the typical tourist itinerary. With this guide, you‚Äôre set to explore the depths of Korean culture, history, and scenery‚Äîall while keeping the kids engaged and making the logistics as smooth as possible. Enjoy your journey down the road less traveled, and cherish the memories you‚Äôll make in my homeland!
