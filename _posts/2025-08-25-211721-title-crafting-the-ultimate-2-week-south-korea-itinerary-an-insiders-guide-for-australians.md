Forget the Tourist Traps: My Real 2-Week Korea Itinerary for Aussie Families

When my partner‚Äôs parents visited Seoul for the first time, they had a checklist torn from a guidebook: palaces, towers, and trendy restaurants. After a long morning exploring Gyeongbok Palace, they were ready for the fancy tourist-recommended lunch spot. Instead, I pulled them into a tiny, steamy restaurant tucked away in an alley, filled with local office workers slurping down bowls of soup. My father-in-law looked skeptical, but after his first spoonful of hearty *dwaeji gukbap* (pork and rice soup), his face lit up. That simple, $9 meal became one of his favourite memories of the trip.

That's the Korea I want you to experience‚Äînot the polished version for tourists, but the authentic, heartwarming, and often cheaper, version that locals love. This itinerary is designed to give your family those unforgettable *gukbap* moments.

### üëé The Myeongdong Tourist Trap (and Where to Eat Instead)

Every guide sends families to **Myeongdong** for shopping and street food. Please, don't make it your main food destination. In recent years, it has become a caricature of itself. The street food is now wildly overpriced (think $15 for a lobster tail with cheese, which no Korean eats), the crowds are overwhelming, and the shops are mostly the same international brands you can find in Sydney.

**The Insider Alternative:** For a truly authentic market experience, take your family to **Gwangjang Market**. It's one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in Seoul, and it‚Äôs pure, chaotic fun. Here, you can sit shoulder-to-shoulder with locals on a bench and eat life-changing *bindaetteok* (mung bean pancakes) and *mayak gimbap* (addictively delicious mini seaweed rolls) for just a few dollars. This is the real deal.

### üó∫Ô∏è The Ultimate 14-Day Family Itinerary

This plan balances the must-sees with local secrets, all at a family-friendly pace.

#### **Days 1-4: Seoul Secrets üèôÔ∏è**

Start in the heart of it all. I recommend staying in the **Jongno** or **Anguk** area, where you're steps away from palaces and traditional *hanok* houses.

* **Insider Tip #1:** Before you go to **Gyeongbokgung Palace**, rent *hanboks* (traditional Korean clothes) for the whole family from one of the many shops just outside the palace walls. Why? Because anyone wearing a *hanbok* gets **FREE entry** to the palace! It saves you money and the kids will have an absolute blast pretending to be princes and princesses for the day. It's the best photo opportunity you'll get all trip.
* Spend an afternoon getting lost in the charming alleys of **Bukchon Hanok Village**.
* Dedicate an evening to the sights, sounds, and smells of **Gwangjang Market** for dinner.

#### **Days 5-7: Busan's Coastal Vibe üåä**

Take the high-speed KTX train from Seoul to Busan (book tickets online via the **Korail** website beforehand). Busan feels like a different country‚Äîmore laid-back and salty.

* While Haeundae Beach is famous, I take my family to the quieter **Songjeong Beach**. The waves are gentler, and it‚Äôs a favourite spot for local families.
* Visit the colourful and quirky **Gamcheon Culture Village**. The steep hills can be a challenge with a stroller, but the views are worth it.
* For dinner, skip the massive Jagalchi Fish Market and head to **Millak Raw Fish Town** right next to Gwangalli Beach for fresher seafood with a stunning view of the Gwangan Bridge.

#### **Days 8-10: History Comes Alive in Gyeongju üèØ**

From Busan, it's a short bus ride to Gyeongju, the ancient capital of the Silla Kingdom. This city is literally an open-air museum. Rent bicycles (many shops have tandem bikes or bikes with child seats) and explore the massive, grass-covered royal tombs scattered around the city. It‚Äôs a history lesson the kids won't even realise they're getting.

#### **Days 11-14: Jeju Island Adventures & Return to Seoul ‚úàÔ∏è**

Fly from Busan to the volcanic paradise of Jeju Island. It's Korea's answer to Hawaii and is perfect for nature-loving families.

* **Insider Tip #2:** Renting a car is essential, but **do not** line up at the rental counters inside the airport terminal. The queues are famously long. Instead, follow the signs for the free shuttle buses that take you to the massive rental car depots located 5 minutes away. The process is ten times faster. Also, **Google Maps does not work properly for driving directions in Korea.** You must download a local app like **Naver Maps** or **Kakao Maps** before you arrive.
* Explore the waterfalls, hike a family-friendly trail on Hallasan Mountain, and relax on the black sand beaches.
* Fly back to Seoul for your last night before your departure.

### ‚ùå Common Rookie Mistakes Aussie Families Make

1. **Relying on Google Maps:** I can't stress this enough. For walking and driving directions, it's practically useless in Korea. Download **Naver Maps** and set the language to English.
2. **Not Getting a T-money Card:** This is your public transport essential. Buy one at any convenience store upon arrival. You can use it for subways and buses in any city and even pay for things at convenience stores. It‚Äôs much easier than buying single-trip tickets every time.
3. **Over-scheduling Your Days:** Seoul is enormous. Getting from one place to another takes time, especially with kids in tow. Plan for one major activity in the morning and one in the afternoon, with plenty of cafe breaks in between. Don't try to cram too much in.

This itinerary is just a starting point. The real magic happens when you wander down a side street and find your own *gukbap* moment. Enjoy my homeland!
