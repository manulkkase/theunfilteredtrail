### How My Saigon Partner Saved Me From Tourist Prices: A Real Guide to Vietnam on a Budget

The taxi driver at Tan Son Nhat airport smiled and quoted me a price to our hotel. It sounded reasonable—about what I’d pay for a short trip back home in Australia. I was tired from the flight and about to agree when my partner, who was born and raised in Saigon, let out a laugh. She said a few sharp, quick words in Vietnamese, pointed at the meter, and suddenly the driver’s price was cut by more than half. In that moment, I realized there were two ways to experience Vietnam: the tourist way, and the local way.

Forget the generic advice. This is the guide I wish I’d had on that first trip. These are my partner’s golden rules for seeing the real Vietnam without getting ripped off.

### 🤫 The Tourist Trap You Must Skip (and Where to Go Instead)

Every tourist in Ho Chi Minh City is told they *must* go to **Ben Thanh Market**. Honestly, my partner and I avoid it. It’s a dizzying maze of aggressive vendors, and every price tag is inflated tenfold for foreigners. It’s an exhausting experience, not an authentic one.

**The Insider Alternative:** For a real market experience, we always go to **Binh Tay Market** in Cholon (District 6). This is a sprawling, wholesale market where the locals *actually* shop. The prices are real, the atmosphere is a chaotic symphony of genuine commerce, and you won’t be hassled at every turn. You'll find everything from textiles and housewares to incredible food stalls without the tourist markup. It’s a bit of a ride from the city centre, but it’s worth it.

### 🍜 The $2 Litmus Test for Finding Perfect Street Food

"Eat street food" is easy advice to give, but how do you pick the right stall from the hundreds you’ll see? My partner taught me a simple litmus test that has never failed us.

* **Insider Tip #1: Look for the Lunch Rush.** The best sign of a great stall is a crowd of locals, especially office workers or students, between 12 PM and 1 PM. High turnover means the food is fresh, safe, and delicious. If it's empty during peak hours, walk away.
* **Insider Tip #2: The "One-Trick Pony" Rule.** The absolute best stalls are hyper-specialized. They don’t have a huge menu; they make one or two dishes perfectly, whether it’s *phở*, *bún chả*, or *bánh mì*. That’s their craft, and they’ve been perfecting it for years.

Follow these rules, and you're guaranteed an incredible, authentic meal for less than a couple of Aussie dollars.

### 🛵 My Partner’s Golden Rules for a Perfect Trip

These are the non-negotiable, hyper-specific tips she gives to any friend or family member visiting us.

1. **The Coffee Stool Rule.** You’ll see fancy, air-conditioned cafes everywhere, but the soul of Vietnamese coffee lives on the sidewalk. **Insider Tip:** The best *cà phê sữa đá* (iced coffee with condensed milk) is served at tiny, nameless stalls with little plastic stools. It’s strong, cheap (it should never cost more than 25,000 VND, about $1.50 AUD), and it’s where you’ll see daily life unfold. Skip the Instagram cafes for your daily brew.
2. **The Grab App is Your Price Anchor.** Don't just use the Grab app (Southeast Asia's Uber) to book rides. **Insider Tip:** Before you even hail a traditional taxi (like the reliable Vinasun or Mai Linh brands), open the Grab app and check the estimated fare to your destination. This gives you a baseline price. If a metered taxi ride costs significantly more, you know something is wrong. It’s your secret weapon against "scenic routes."

### ❌ Common Money Mistakes Aussie Travellers Make

A few small mistakes can add up quickly. Avoid these common fumbles.

* **Mistake #1: Exchanging Money at the Airport.** The exchange rates at the airport are terrible. You’ll get a much better rate at the gold shops or jewellery stores in the city centre (yes, really!). It feels a bit strange, but it's a completely normal and legal way to get the best bang for your buck.
* **Mistake #2: Not Having Small Bills.** Trying to pay for a $1 street food snack with a 500,000 VND note ($30 AUD) is a classic rookie move. Many vendors won't have change. Always break your large notes at a convenience store (like Circle K) whenever you can, and hoard your smaller 10,000 and 20,000 VND notes.
* **Mistake #3: Taking the First Price for Souvenirs.** In designated markets, bargaining is expected and part of the fun. My partner’s advice is to smile, be polite, and offer about half the asking price. You’ll likely meet somewhere in the middle. (Note: This does not apply to food or in regular stores with price tags!).

Vietnam is an incredibly affordable country, but travelling smart means you can see more, do more, and experience its culture on a deeper level. It’s not about being cheap; it’s about being savvy—the local way.
