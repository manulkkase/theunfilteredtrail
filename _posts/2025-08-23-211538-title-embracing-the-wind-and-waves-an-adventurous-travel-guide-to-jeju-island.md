Every guidebook tells you to visit Jeju Island for its picturesque views, but let me take you beyond the postcards to where the locals truly connect with this volcanic gem. Growing up in Seoul, Jeju was our go-to retreat‚Äîan escape to a world where nature rules majestically.

### üöó Start Your Engines: Renting a Car on Jeju Island

Jeju is an island that begs to be explored on four wheels. Renting a car is not just a convenience but a necessity to fully embrace the freedom of this expansive island. From the moment you land, pick up a car right at Jeju International Airport. Remember to bring your international driving permit‚Äîa straightforward process that opens up a treasure trove of hidden spots only accessible by car. The coastal drives are serene, with the ocean on one side and volcanic landscapes on the other, offering an adventure at every turn.

### üåã Conquering Hallasan: A Hike to Remember

Rising at the heart of Jeju Island, Hallasan is not just a mountain‚Äîit's a journey through diverse ecosystems, leading you to the highest point in South Korea. When I was a child, my family treasured the climb, which culminates at the Baengnokdam crater lake, a sight that's both humbling and exhilarating. For families, it's a challenging but rewarding hike, with well-maintained trails and rest areas. Start early to enjoy the tranquility and pack a picnic to enjoy amidst the clouds.

### üåä Hidden Gems: Waterfalls and Beaches Off the Beaten Path

While Jeongbang Waterfall and Hyeopjae Beach are popular, let me take you to where we locals love to unwind. Visit the lesser-known Cheonjiyeon Waterfall early in the morning to enjoy the serene sound of water in peace, or discover Woljeongri Beach, where the sand is soft and the cafes are cozy. These spots are not only breathtaking but also more accommodating for families with small children, offering easier access and less crowded spaces.

### üç¥ Flavorful Feast: Where to Relish Jeju Black Pork BBQ

No trip to Jeju is complete without indulging in the island's famous black pork BBQ. My partner, who has a refined palate for authentic Korean cuisine, insists that you try Donsadon in Jeju City. Here, the pork is grilled to smoky perfection, and the familial atmosphere makes everyone feel at home. It's a place where even our little ones enjoy the flavors, with kid-friendly options available.

### üåÖ Sunrise at Seongsan Ilchulbong: Worth the Early Alarm

Seongsan Ilchulbong, or Sunrise Peak, offers a dramatic start to the day that's hard to pass up. Climbing this tuff cone at dawn rewards you with a panoramic view of the sun rising over the sea‚Äîan unforgettable spectacle. The climb is moderately easy, suitable for families, and the surrounding area is dotted with charming cafes where you can savor a warm drink after your early morning adventure.

As your insider guide, I promise that Jeju Island is more than just a scenic spot‚Äîit's a vibrant landscape filled with adventures that cater to every traveler. From the rugged trails of Hallasan to the sizzling grills of black pork BBQ, there's an abundance of experiences waiting to be discovered. Pack your bags, embrace the spirit of adventure, and let Jeju Island leave you mesmerized.
