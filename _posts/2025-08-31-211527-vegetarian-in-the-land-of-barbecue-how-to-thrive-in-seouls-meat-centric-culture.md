**Subtle tricks and treats for the plant-based traveler, from a Seoul-born vegetarian enthusiast**

---

I remember the look on my friend's face when I first told him I was vegetarian‚Äîit was a mix of confusion and concern. He couldn't fathom how I could survive without samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) or bulgogi. But growing up in Seoul, I learned not only to survive but to enjoy a rich tapestry of vegetarian delights that the city has to offer. Let me take you through some of my favorite spots and tips, so you too can revel in the lesser-known vegetarian-friendly side of Seoul.

### Discover the Hidden Gem of Temple Cuisine üåø

Temple food, prepared by Buddhist monks, is the heart and soul of vegetarian dining in Seoul. At the serene Balwoo Gongyang, located across from the beautiful Jogyesa Temple, you'll experience why. The monks prepare meals that respect the life of all beings, which means no meat, no fish, and not even pungent vegetables like garlic or onion that are staples in Korean cooking. Each dish is a meditation on flavor, balanced and subtly seasoned.

**Insider Tip:** Ask for a "balwoo gongyang," which refers specifically to temple cuisine. It‚Äôs not only a meal; it's a spiritual and cultural journey.

### Navigate Menus Like a Local üìú

Navigating menus in Seoul might seem daunting at first. Many popular dishes are meat-based, but there are always vegetarian options hidden in plain sight. Look for "bibimbap" without meat, or "kimbap" that uses ingredients like egg, spinach, and pickled radish instead of ham or tuna.

**Insider Tip:** Learn a few phrases in Korean to make your dietary preferences clear. "Gogi bbae juseyo" (please remove the meat) and "chaesik joo-een" (vegetarian) will be your best friends. Don't hesitate to point and ask, "Igo mwoyeyo?" (What is this?) to ensure you know what‚Äôs being served.

### Convenience Store Snacks: A Hidden Treasure Trove üçô

One of my go-to hacks for vegetarian eating in Seoul involves hitting up the local convenience stores. You‚Äôd be surprised at the variety of vegetarian-friendly snacks available. From "gimbap" (seaweed rice rolls) to "yachae twigim" (vegetable tempura), and an array of rice-based snacks, there‚Äôs always something quick and satisfying.

**Insider Tip:** Look for "cupbap," a cup of rice with various vegetarian toppings, available at most convenience stores. It's cheap, filling, and surprisingly tasty!

### Best Vegan Restaurants: Beyond Traditional ü•ó

While traditional Korean vegetarian food is infused with history, Seoul‚Äôs modern vegan scene is vibrant and innovative. PLANT, located in Itaewon, is a cozy bistro that offers everything from vegan burgers to decadent desserts. Their bakery items, like the banana bread and carrot cake, are must-tries.

**Common Rookie Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Assuming all kimchi is vegetarian: Traditional kimchi is often made with fish sauce. Always check or opt for vegan kimchi.
- Overlooking street food: Many street foods like "hotteok" (sweet pancakes) are vegetarian and utterly delicious!

### Enjoy Seoul's Vegetarian Delights Without Fret üåº

Navigating a meat-centric culinary landscape as a vegetarian might seem challenging, but Seoul is full of delightful surprises waiting to be discovered. From the tranquility and tradition of temple food to the convenience of grab-and-go snacks and the innovation of modern vegan eateries, there‚Äôs something for every vegetarian traveler in this bustling city. So dive in, explore with confidence, and enjoy the vegetarian side of Seoul that many never get to see. Let your taste buds lead the way to a memorable, meat-free journey!
