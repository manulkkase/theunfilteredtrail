#### Uncover hidden gems and family-friendly spots to enjoy the country's most enchanting season.

Every guidebook and travel site will point you to the usual haunts like Yeouido Park in Seoul or the bustling Jinhae Gunhangje Festival during cherry blossom season. But let me share with you the places where I, growing up in Seoul, truly felt the magic of spring away from the crowds.

## ðŸŒ¸ Where the Locals Go: A Hidden Riverside Retreat
When I was a child, my family and I would skip the crowded city spots and head to a lesser-known riverside in Yangpyeong, about an hour's drive from Seoul. Here, the cherry trees line tranquil waters, creating a breathtaking canopy. Itâ€™s perfect for families as the area is spacious and not as frequented by tourists, making it safer for children to run around. Plus, the nearby cafes often have kid-friendly menus, which means you can relax with a cup of coffee after a leisurely picnic under the blossoms.

## ðŸŒ¼ Family Picnic Like a Seoulite
Picnicking under cherry blossoms is an art form in Korea, and Iâ€™ve mastered it through many spring seasons. For a truly local experience, venture to the slopes of Namsan. It's surprisingly less crowded than youâ€™d expect, and the hillside location offers stunning views of the city framed by blooming cherry trees. Bring a mat, some traditional Korean snacks like kimbap and pajeon, and enjoy a serene lunch. The trails are stroller-friendly, so itâ€™s a breeze to navigate with little ones.

## ðŸŒ± Small Town Charm with Big Blossom Views: Discover Gyeongju
Bypass the usual tourist trail and head to Gyeongju, an ancient city with royal tombs surrounded by cherry trees. Spring here is not just about the blossoms; it's about experiencing the history that permeates the air. The open spaces are great for kids to explore, and the local spring festivals often include cultural performances that captivate all ages.

## ðŸŒº Avoid the Crowds: A Secret Garden in the City
A little known fact among tourists is that many university campuses in Seoul are adorned with cherry trees. Venture to the campus of Kyung Hee University, where the Gothic architecture creates an almost surreal backdrop for cherry blossom viewing. Itâ€™s typically quiet on weekends, perfect for a peaceful stroll.

## ðŸŽ‰ Embrace the Festival Spirit, Locally
If youâ€™re in Korea during spring, you might still want to experience the energy of a cherry blossom festival but without the overwhelming crowds. My partner, whoâ€™s from Vietnam but has come to love Korean culture, was charmed by the local vibe of the Seokchon Lake Cherry Blossom Festival in Seoul. Itâ€™s more subdued than Jinhae but no less beautiful, with cultural events and food stalls that offer a taste of Korea without the elbow-to-elbow jostling.

Spring in Korea is a celebration of natureâ€™s renewal, and experiencing it like a local, especially with family, makes it even more special. From hidden riverside views to historic cities, these spots offer a glimpse into the heart of Korean culture during its most picturesque season. So pack a picnic, grab your camera, and make your spring travel in Korea a family adventure filled with beauty and tranquility.
