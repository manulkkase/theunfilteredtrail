#### Relive the Magic of 'Goblin' and 'Crash Landing on You' with a Local's Touch

Growing up in Seoul, I never quite saw it through the lens of the glossy K-dramas until I returned from Australia with my family. Last spring, my wife and I decided to recreate some of the most iconic scenes from "Goblin" and "Crash Landing on You." It turned into a romantic rediscovery of my hometown, peppered with nostalgia and the thrill of standing right where the stars had stood. From the majestic views at Jumunjin Beach to the quaint alleys of Ihwa Mural Village, each location held a story waiting to be told through our eyes.

### A Day with the Goblins: The Ultimate Goblin Itinerary üìç

**Start at Jumunjin Beach**
Remember the scene where Ji Eun-tak first summons the Goblin on her 19th birthday? That was Jumunjin Beach. Arrive early in the morning to avoid the crowd and capture that serene, misty backdrop without the throngs of tourists. Here's a tip: stand at the exact spot near the breakwater, marked by a small pile of stones left by fellow fans.

**Lunch at a Hidden Gem**
After soaking in the salty air, head to a little-known seaside restaurant I stumbled upon, about ten minutes from the beach. They serve the freshest seafood pancake, crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, perfect for refueling before the next stop.

**Ihwa Mural Village: Not Just Another Scenic Spot**
In the afternoon, we ventured to Ihwa Mural Village, where the Goblin and the Grim Reaper had their iconic walk. Instead of just snapping photos, participate in a local art project that often takes place. Engaging with the community gives you a deeper connection to the place, something no regular tour can offer.

### Crashing Into Love: Crash Landing on You Tour Spots üõ¨

**Panmunjom Replica in the Heart of the City**
It's not every day you get to recreate a crash landing. Visit the replica of the Panmunjom, used in the drama. It's lesser known compared to its real counterpart but offers a more intimate and less commercialized experience. My wife, a die-hard fan of the drama, found it surreal to stand in the very spot Yoon Se-ri did.

**Nami Island: Beyond the Tourist Fares**
End the day at Nami Island, a site famous for many dramas, not just Crash Landing on You. Avoid the main pathways and explore the back trails. The island's lesser-known corners offer tranquility and spots where you can have heartfelt conversations, just like Ri Jeong-hyuk and Yoon Se-ri.

### Making the Most of Your K-Drama Pilgrimage üì∏

**Photo Challenges and More**
Bring your drama fantasy to life with a photo challenge. Recreate iconic scenes, and add your personal twist. My wife and I had a blast mimicking the stoic expressions of Goblin and the Grim Reaper with Seoul's skyline in the backdrop. Share these on social media with specific hashtags like #KDramaDayOut to connect with fellow enthusiasts.

**Rookie Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **Timing is Everything**: Visit popular spots early or late in the day to dodge the crowds.
2. **Dress Appropriately**: Some sites are more conservative, or require a bit of a hike. Comfortable shoes and layers are your best friends.
3. **Check Local Events**: Some locations host special events which can offer unique photo opportunities or, conversely, make access more challenging.

Embarking on this pilgrimage not only allowed us to step into the shoes of our favorite characters but also to see Seoul in a light that only true love (for K-dramas and each other!) can reveal. Whether you're a seasoned fan or new to the world of K-dramas, these spots promise a blend of fantasy and reality, all set against the vibrant backdrop of Seoul. So grab your camera, your loved ones, and let your drama dreams take flight in the heart of Korea!
