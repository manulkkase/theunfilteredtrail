#### From one expat to another: everything Australians need to know about braving the cold in Korea.

Every travel guide might tell you what to see in Seoul during winter, but let me share something crucial about surviving the cold that I learned the hard way. Growing up in Seoul, winter was a season of magic and harshness, where the biting cold could catch any unsuspecting visitor off guard.

### 🧣 Layer Like a Local: Essential Tips
When I was growing up in Seoul, my mother had a saying: “It’s all about the layers.” This couldn't be truer. Start with a thermal base layer – think merino wool or a tech fabric – which is thin yet warm. Add a fleece or a wool sweater for your middle layer, and top it off with a waterproof, windproof jacket. Remember, mobility is just as important as warmth; you don’t want to feel like a walking bundle, unable to enjoy the sights around you!

### 👢 Boots and Accessories: The Real Deal
A common mistake many of my Australian friends make is underestimating the footwear needed in Seoul’s winter. Opt for waterproof, insulated boots with a good grip. Streets can be slippery, and the last thing you want is to be caught off-guard by icy patches. Don’t forget accessories like a warm beanie, gloves, and a scarf. These can be stylish as well as functional. If you find yourself needing extra, Seoul's markets and shops offer trendy, affordable options that you might not find back home.

### 🎒 What to Pack: A Checklist Beyond Clothes
Beyond clothing, there are a few more items I’d recommend for your suitcase:
- A good quality lip balm and moisturizer to combat the dry, harsh wind.
- A portable power bank – cold weather can drain your phone battery faster than usual.
- Sunglasses might seem odd, but winter sun reflecting off snow can be quite glaring.

### 🛍️ Embrace Local Markets: What to Buy in Korea
If you arrive and find your gear inadequate, don’t panic. Visit places like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun markets where you can grab high-quality winter wear at reasonable prices. These are the spots where locals go to get their winter essentials. You can find everything from stylish coats and hats to hand-warmers and thermal curtains!

### 🧸 Kid-Approved: Packing for the Little Ones
Traveling with kids? Make sure their winter wear is not only warm but also comfortable and easy to put on and take off. Seoul is wonderfully kid-friendly, with many cafes and malls providing little play areas. Pack similar layers for your kids, and consider snow boots and thermal socks as essentials. Keep an eye out for cute and functional children’s winter wear in local shops – they make great keepsakes too!

### A Warm Farewell from Your Insider Guide
Navigating a Seoul winter can be daunting, but with these tips, you'll be as prepared as any local. Remember, the city's winter beauty is truly rewarding, with its crisp air and the soft, white landscapes. So, bundle up, embrace the adventure, and you’ll find the charm of Seoul in its coldest months. Safe travels, and stay warm!
