## 1. ✈️ Flights From Australia to Korea – What You Need to Know

First off – yes, it's a long flight, but it’s not *that* bad. Direct flights from Sydney to Seoul take about 8.5 hours. That’s basically one Netflix binge session + a nap. Korean Air, Jetstar, Asiana... you’ve got choices. Prices? Around $700–1,200 AUD depending on when you book. Pro tip: avoid school holidays unless you like paying double. Melbourne and Brisbane have solid options too – Asiana and Korean Air fly direct from there as well. Oh, and don’t forget to check your baggage allowance – Korean BBQ souvenirs weigh more than you think. 😂

## 2. 🧳 What to Pack, What NOT to Forget

Forget the bulky power adapter? RIP to your phone charger life. South Korea uses 220V with round two-pin plugs, so pack the right adapter or grab one at the airport. Also, it gets cold – like bone-chilling, snowflake-on-your-eyelashes cold in winter. Bring layers, not just Insta-worthy outfits. And T-money card? Absolute essential for subways and buses. Can’t stress this enough. Get one at any convenience store. Oh – and download Papago. Google Translate’s awkward. Papago speaks fluent Seoulite.

## 3. 🍽️ Korean Food You Must Try (Or Regret Forever)

You're not truly in Korea until you've eaten grilled meat at 2AM with soju in hand. Korean BBQ is life, okay? Gangnam’s Maple Tree House is a classic. For street eats, Myeongdong is snack heaven – spicy tteokbokki, tornado potatoes, hotteok... your stomach will thank you, your jeans won’t. And if someone offers you a raw octopus (san-nakji)? Chew quickly 😳. Also, no tipping – service is included. But do say “jal meokgetseumnida!” before eating – it means “I’ll eat well” and Koreans *love* it.

## 4. 🏙️ Seoul Itinerary That Doesn’t Miss

Day 1: Play royalty at Gyeongbokgung Palace (wear a hanbok, get free entry!), stroll Bukchon Hanok Village, then hit up traditional Insadong.  
Day 2: It’s K-pop time – Hongdae, Gangnam, then lose yourself in COEX Mall.  
Day 3: Myeongdong shopping, N Seoul Tower (hello panoramic views), and Dongdaemun night market.  
Day 4: DMZ tour – surreal and sobering.  
Day 5? Jeju Island day trip or Lotte World for thrills.  

Seriously, this city *never* sleeps.

## 5. 🛏️ Where to Stay – From Hostels to Luxe Pads

If you're in Seoul, Myeongdong is your bestie for shopping, while Hongdae is for the night owls and K-pop fans. Gangnam? Fancy, clean, sleek – but your wallet might cry. Budget-wise, hostels from $50 AUD/night exist (clean and cool!), mid-range hotels run $150–250 AUD, and if you’re feeling fancy, splurge in Gangnam’s 5-star stunners. Don’t skip Itaewon either – very international, great for solo travellers and foodies who miss avocado toast 😅.

## 6. 🤖 AI Travel Hacks That Actually Work

Got decision fatigue? Let AI do the legwork. Try this prompt on ChatGPT:  
“Create a 5-day Seoul itinerary for K-pop fans. Budget: $200 AUD/day.” Boom, itinerary done.  
Apps to install:  
- Papago (fluent in Konglish)  
- Subway Korea (trust me, Seoul’s metro is a beast)  
- MangoPlate (find the best eats where locals go)  
- Klook (tour deals, SIM cards, attractions)  
Honestly, AI is the best travel buddy – no arguing over where to eat!

## 💬 Burning Questions from Fellow Aussie Travelers

🔹 Is Korea safe for solo travellers?  
Yup – one of the safest places you’ll ever visit. People leave phones on café tables. At night. And come back to find them still there. Wild.

🔹 Do I need a visa to visit from Australia?  
Not exactly a visa, but you DO need a K-ETA (Korea Electronic Travel Authorization). Apply online before you fly – super easy, about $10 AUD.

🔹 How much cash should I bring?  
A lot of places still prefer cash – yes, really. Especially street food stalls. Around $100–200 AUD worth of Korean won in cash is a solid start. But don’t panic – ATMs are everywhere.
