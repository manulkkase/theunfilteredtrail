### From a Seoul native's nostalgic trips to Yongma Land to discovering Dongdaemun Design Plaza's futuristic scenesâ€”here's how to truly walk in the footsteps of your favorite idols.

- - -

My childhood weekends often involved exploring the less trodden paths of Seoul with my friends, pretending to be adventurers uncovering hidden treasures. Little did I know that one of these 'treasures', Yongma Land, an abandoned amusement park on the outskirts of Seoul, would years later become a hotspot for K-pop music video shoots. Picture this: the eerie yet intriguing backdrop of rusting rides and faded murals, now immortalized in the vibrant dance sequences of groups like Crayon Pop and BTS. It was surreal to watch a place from my childhood memories transformed into a canvas for such dynamic artistry.

### Rediscover the Magic of Yongma Land ðŸŽ 

**Personal Experience**
Returning to Yongma Land with my own kids, albeit in a very different context, was nothing short of magical. I guided them through the same spaces where famous K-pop idols had performed, sharing clips from music videos to show the transformation. It's one thing to see these locations on screen; it's another to stand where idols once danced and sang.

**Insider Tips**

* **Best Time to Visit:** Aim for early morning or late afternoon during weekdays to avoid crowds and get the best natural lighting for photos.
* **Must-Capture Shot:** Don't miss the iconic merry-go-round. Itâ€™s featured in multiple music videos and offers a perfect blend of nostalgia and cool for your Instagram feed.

### Step into the Future at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) ðŸŒŒ

**Personal Insight**
The first time my partner and I visited DDP, we were awestruck by its neo-futuristic design, which has served as the backdrop for music videos like Big Bang's "Bae Bae." The contrast of the traditional markets and historical sites of Seoul with this ultramodern structure offers a unique narrative of Seoul's architectural evolution.

**Insider Tips**

* **Spot to Visit:** Check out the LED rose garden at night for an enchanting experience. Itâ€™s not just a hit in MVs but also a mesmerizing sight in person.
* **Photo Tip:** Capture the curves of the building from the outside; its metallic surface reflects the city lights beautifully at dusk.

### Avoid the Obvious: Going Beyond Common Tourist Spots ðŸ¤«

**Tourist Trap to Avoid**
While places like N Seoul Tower and Gangnam Street are popular filming locations, they can be overcrowded and may not always offer the intimate K-pop connection youâ€™re seeking.

**A Better Alternative**
Explore the Ihwa Mural Village. It's less crowded and features stunning street art that provides a colorful and vibrant backdrop similar to those seen in MVs. Plus, walking through Ihwa offers a glimpse into the everyday life of Seoulites, adding depth to your travel experience.

### Common Rookie Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overlooking Local Regulations:** Always check if photography is allowed. Some spots require permits or have restrictions.
2. **Timing Is Everything:** Research the best times for photos to avoid harsh lighting or crowds that can detract from your experience.
3. **Dress Appropriately:** Many videos feature fancy outfits, but comfortable clothing and good walking shoes are key when exploring these locations.

Rediscovering these iconic spots through the lens of both a local and a K-pop fan has been an exhilarating experience. Whether you're a seasoned K-pop enthusiast or a curious traveler, Seoul offers a unique blend of the old and new, the traditional and the trendy. I hope this guide helps you capture not just photos but also the vibrant spirit of K-pop culture. Happy location hunting, and may your travels be as colorful and dynamic as a K-pop music video!
